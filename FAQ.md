# FAQ

**How do I install Lilith?** See [Getting Started](getting_started.md)

**Why do I have to connect to localhost?**
Because of the way Lilith currently works. This allows Lilith to be much more advanced than any other duels overlay.

**Does it work on Lunar?** 
Lilith works on any client.

**Will I get banned for using Lilith?**
Lilith is not detectable serverside. However, it is easily found in a screenshare, so it is not recommended to use whilst recording. **Note:** Lilith cannot be held responsible for any bans that occur while using the service.

**Where's autododge?** It's still a work in progress, but it'll blow you away when it releases.

**Will Lilith steal my account details?** No. If we wanted to steal your account details, we would make it mandatory for you to enter them. The reason that this option is available is so that Lilith can be used on clients like Lunar, or Badlion. You can see through the usage of Wireshark that no private information like your Hypixel API key or account credentials are ever communicated to an external server by Lilith, except to the official Mojang servers for login.
