# FAQ

**How do I install Lilith?** See [Getting Started](getting_started.md)

**Why do I have to connect to localhost?**
Because of the way Lilith currently works as a proxy. This allows Lilith to be much more advanced than any other duels overlay. If you would like to know more, please contact a staff member.

**Does it work on Lunar?** 
Lilith works on any client, including forge.

**Will I get banned for using Lilith?**
Lilith is not detectable serverside. As of now, no one has gotten banned for using it. However, it is easily found in a screenshare, so it is not recommended to use whilst recording. **Note:** Lilith cannot be held responsible for any bans that occur while using the service. If you play gamemodes like ranked bedwars or Bridge Scrims please check with their staff teams regarding their policy on Lilith usage to ensure you don't break any rules.

**Where's autododge?** 
It's still a work in progress, but it'll blow you away when it releases.

**Will Lilith steal my account details?** No. If we wanted to steal your account details, we would make it mandatory for you to enter them. The reason that this option is available is so that Lilith can be used on clients like Lunar, or Badlion. You can see through the usage of Wireshark that no private information like your Hypixel API key or account credentials are ever communicated to an external server by Lilith, except to the official Mojang servers for login. Additionally, the details you may enter into your .toml file are stored locally and we cannot view them even if we wanted to. If you have further concerns about security please contact a staff member.

**Is Lilith Open Source?**
At this time, not all parts of Lilith are open source to preserve the integrity of the methods used to denick players and grab uuids. However some parts of Lilith are open source, like this website and the api wrapper we use. If you have more questions regarding Lilith's source code please contact a staff member.

**Will Lilith always be free?**
While Lilith is still in its beta stages of development, it will continue to be free. However, after 1.0 releases we plan on adding premium, paid features on top of the free features you already know and love. Please note that there will still be a free version of Lilith.

**How do I partner with Lilith?**
If you have a decent following on a social media platform like Youtube, Twitch, etc, or own a discord server that aligns with Liltith (a forge modding server for example) please contact an adminstrator or developer to discuss further.
