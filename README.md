# Lilith Documentation

Welcome to the new and improved Lilith documentation! Here you can find guides and references for usage of every part of Lilith.

## Queuestats

Lilith features the most customizable, comprehensive, and reliable queuestats out of any overlay or mod. While currently only Duels is supported, Bedwars, Skywars, Mega Walls, Blitz, and UHC support is on the way.

## Autododge

Lilith's WIP autododge feature is the most advanced on the market, with as much customizabilty as you'd want and more.

## Configuration

Want to show overall bridge stats instead of more specific bridge modes? Possible. Want to keep names hidden in tablist and nametags? Also possible. Almost every part of Lilith is fully customizable and configurable, and more is added to the config all the time.

## Support

Through the use of discord tickets, everyone is able to make use of one-on-one support with the Lilith developer.

## Licensing

Lilith is currently in a beta state and licenses are free. That being said, you must still apply by dming `ghqst#0001` on Discord.
