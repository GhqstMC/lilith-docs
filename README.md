# Lilith Documentation

Welcome to the new and improved Lilith documentation! Here you can find guides and references for usage of every part of Lilith. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact a staff member.

## Features

**Queuestats**
Lilith features the most customizable, comprehensive, and reliable queuestats out of any overlay or mod. While currently only Duels is supported, Bedwars, Skywars, Mega Walls, Blitz, and UHC support is on the way.

**Autododge**
Lilith's WIP autododge feature is the most advanced on the market, with as much customizabilty as you'd want and more.

**Configuration**
Want to show overall bridge stats instead of more specific bridge modes? Possible. Want to keep names hidden in tablist and nametags? Also possible. Almost every part of Lilith is fully customizable and configurable, and more is added to the config all the time.

**Support**
Through the use of discord tickets, everyone is able to make use of one-on-one support with the Lilith developer. However, before making a ticket, please check the guides and community support channels to see if your answer can be easily fixed with information from there.

## Licensing

In Lilith's beta state, trial licenses can be obtained by applying on our discord: https://discord.lilithmod.xyz. Currently, Lilith will not work if you are not licensed.
